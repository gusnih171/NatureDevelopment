Had to upload a lower version of the background video.

https://www.pexels.com/video/flowing-water-in-a-river-7151641/ Here you can download the real version of the background with higher quality.


In the JSON file "launch"; Change the line:
"file": "c:\\Users\\gusnih171\\Documents\\Nature Development\\Website.html"
Change the location so it is correct with your computer to make it work.
